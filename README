Chicago hotels are largely concentrated around the downtown with few boutique hotels located throughout the surrounding neighborhoods.

Airbnb has largely filled the void of available stays outside of that area.

Using data from api scrapers from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html for our Chicago Airbnb data
and Chicago neighborhood info via the City of Chicago's data portal we can explore how these listings span the city.

Examining density and cst neighborhood can be beneficial for customers looking to see what neighborhoods have the most options
and which are the most affordable.
